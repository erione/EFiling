About EFiling
==============

EFiling is an specially made for my dad's tax consultancy firm. Its just a small prototype of Tally which is the most commonly used application for maintaining tax related data of a firm.
It is implemented in Java and uses MySql as database for storing the data in an organized manner. Its still in alpha phase since I need to add some features like filling/filing tax returns automatically.
